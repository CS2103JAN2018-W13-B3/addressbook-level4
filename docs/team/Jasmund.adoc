== Overview

CLIndar is a desktop application that helps university computing students to manage their tasks and events. The user interacts with it using a CLI. It has a GUI created with JavaFX, and is written in Java.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Makeover of the GUI and the ability to display different views of the GUI
** What it does: As the cells do not display full details of the activity, selecting it will allow the full details
of it being displayed in a separate panel which hides if no activity is selected. The user also can choose to
display task or events only, or both.
** Justification: This feature improves the application significantly because it reduces the clutter in the GUI and
allows the user to switch between different views of the GUI according to his needs.
** Highlights: This enhancement required in-depth analysis of JavaFX. The implementation too was challenging as
building upon the application to include these enhancement required deep understanding of how the existing
application worked.
** Credits: CalendarFX - third-party library. Zoomable pane - //https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16680295/javafx-correct-scaling

* *Minor enhancement*: Enhanced the existing help command. Allows the user to request for help for the command he specified.
