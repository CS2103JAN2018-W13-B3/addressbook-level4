[[Introduction]]
== Introduction
CLIndar is a desktop application that helps university computing students to manage their schedules.
CLIndar is *Common-Line Interface (CLI) based and uses Linux-style commands*, which computing students are familiar with.

This guide provides information on the core functionalities of CLIndar and their implementation, so that a developer can
get started customising and contributing to the application.

Below is an overview of this guide:

[[SettingUp]]
== Setting Up
This section describes the steps needed to set up your computer before you can start developing this application further with your own code.
{empty} +
{empty} +

=== Prerequisites

The following must be installed in your computer before you can begin using the application:

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.
{empty} +
{empty} +

=== Setup Procedures

Do the following steps to set up the project in your computer.


*Step 1:* Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer.

To fork the repo, click the button circled below.

image::Origin Repo.png[width="600"]

Then, open Git Bash. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made. Type the following:

----
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/main.git
----
If the clone was successful, a new sub-directory titled 'main' appears on your local drive. This directory contains the files and metadata that Git requires to maintain the changes you make to the source files. +

The following should appear if `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/main.git` at C:/Users/temp folder is executed.

image::git clone.png[width="600"]
{empty} +

*Step 2:* Open IntelliJ. If you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first, as shown in the picture below. +

image::Close Project.png[width="600"]
{empty} +

*Step 3:* Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle using the following steps, as illustrated by the pictures.

*Step 3a:* Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`.

image::Configure.png[Width="400"]

*Step 3b:* Go to the `Project` tab and under `Project SDK` section, click `New...`. Find the directory of the JDK, and then click OK. +

image::Setup JDK.png[Width="400"]

{empty} +

*Step 4:* Click `Import Project`. +

image::Import Project.png[Width="400"]
{empty} +

*Step 5:* Locate the `build.gradle` file in the `main` folder that you have cloned and select it. Click `OK`. +

image::build.gradle.png[Width="300"]
{empty} +

*Step 6:* In the `Import Project from Gradle` that appears, click `OK` again. +

image::Import Project from Gradle.png[Width="400"]
{empty} +

*Step 7:* Open the `Terminal` and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +

This will generate all resources required by the application and tests. +
{empty} +

=== Setup Verification

Do the following steps to verify that the project has been successfully set up in your computer:

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands.
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure that they all pass.
{empty} +
{empty} +


=== Configurations to Do Before Writing Code

After you set up the project in your own computer, you still need to do the the configurations described in the following sections before you can start developing this application further with your own code.

==== Coding Style Configuration

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify, do the following steps:

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS).
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`.
. Click on the `Imports` tab.

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements.
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`.

After you do the steps above, the Settings window should appear as shown in the picure below.

image::Import Setting.png[Width="400"]


Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write the code.

==== Documentation Updating

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `CS2103JAN2018-W13-B3/main` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product, you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.


==== CI Setup

Travis needs to be set up to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based).

==== Steps to Get Started with Coding

Follow the steps below when you are ready to start coding:

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.
{empty} +
{empty} +

[[Design]]
== Design
This section describes how the features in this application are implemented internally.
{empty} +
{empty} +

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture
_Figure 1_ below illustrates the high-level design of the application.

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for:

* at app launch: initializing the components in the correct sequence and connecting them up with each other; and
* at shut down: shutting down the components and invoking cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level:

* `EventsCenter`: This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design).
* `LogsCenter`: This class is used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the application consists of four components:

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: This component controls the UI of the application.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: This is the command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: This component holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: This component reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components:

* defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the component; and
* exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class. _Figure 2_ below is an overview of the Logic component.

.The API of the Logic Component
image::LogicAPI.png[width="800"]

==== Events-Driven Nature of the Design

_Figure 3_ below shows how the components interact in a scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeleteActivity.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `DeskBoardChangedEvent` when the Desk Board data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates into the hard disk.

_Figure 4_ below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeleteActivityEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

{empty} +

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

_Figure 5_ below shows the architecture diagram of the UI component.

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

{empty} +

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`, `EventListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`].

The `UI` component:

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component;
* binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change; and
* responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

{empty} +

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

_Figure 6_ below shows the architecture diagram of the Logic component.
[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

Finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>> in _Figure 7_ below.

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

{empty} +

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

The following describes the sequence of events executed by the `Logic` component:

.  `Logic` uses the `DeskBoardParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a activity) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("rm task 1")` API call.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

_Figure 9_ below shows the architecture diagram of the Logic component.

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

{empty} +

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model` component:

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences,
* stores the Desk Board data;
* uses two classes to store information about `Event` and `Task` separately;
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Activity>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change; and
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

{empty} +

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

_Figure 10_ below shows the structure of the Storage Component.

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

{empty} +

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component saves and reads back:

* `UserPref` objects in json format, and
* Desk Board data in xml format.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

[[Implementation]]
== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
{empty} +
{empty} +

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature

The current implementation and design considerations for the undo/redo feature are explained in this section.

==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the desk board (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

.Class Diagram of a Logic Command
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the desk board before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th activity in the desk board. The current state of the desk board is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new activity.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the activity was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the desk board to the state before the `add` command executed.

.'Undo' stack pops into the 'Redo' Stack
image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

.'Undo' and 'Redo' Stack Sequence Diagram
image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the desk board to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

.Adding 'ClearCommand' to the 'Undo' Stack
image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

.'ListCommand' does not affect the 'Undo' Stack
image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

This section describes various design considerations related to the implementation of undo/redo feature. For each aspect, we will discuss the 2 alternatives considered and the pros and cons for each alternative.

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire desk board
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the activity being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the desk board (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the remark * book and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== UniqueActivityList
`UniqueActivityList` resides in the `model` component of the application.

*_Figure 17_* below shows the relationship between `UniqueActivityList` and its relevant components.

.Class Diagram for UniqueActivityList
image::UniqueActivityListClassDiagram.png[width="550"]

==== Design Consideration

There are two ways to store information of events and tasks in UniqueActivityList:

* ** Alternative 1 (Current Choice):**
Use the `Activity` Class as a place holder for events and tasks to be stored. Hence, we create two new
Class `Task` and `Event` to store the information and Both classes inherit from the `Activity` Class.
** Pros:
Minor changes to the original structure of the application (except some renaming).
** Cons:
It would be a harder to retrieve information as the parameters `Task` and `Event` contain are different.
Extra accessor methods will also be required for `Event`.

* **Alternative 2 :**
Have two different class completely: `Task` and `Event`. As such, we will also have two different class
`UniqueTaskList` and `UniqueEventList`. Relevant interface and access method will also be modified to
cope with the change.
** Pros:
Clear distinction between the two classes.
** Cons:
Since the interface is now completely changed, a lot more coding will be required to cope with the change.

Since there are overlaps between the two classes in terms of parameters, we decided that the first approach
would be the more efficient and preferred way of implementing the structure of the application. Also, taking
the first approach allows us to practice incremental programming which allows us to have a working release
every week.

==== Autosorting feature
Following is a snippet which illustrates the function of `UniqueActivityList`:

[source,java]
----
    private final ObservableList<Activity> internalList = FXCollections.observableArrayList();

    /...some irrelavant code.../

    public void add(Activity toAdd) throws DuplicateActivityException {
        requireNonNull(toAdd);
        if (contains(toAdd)) {
            throw new DuplicateActivityException();
        }
        internalList.add(toAdd);
        Collections.sort(internalList, dateTimeComparator);
    }
----
`UniqueActivityList` contains a list of unique activities which is either a `Task` or an `Event` and they
 is stored in `internalList`. Each time an `Activity` is added to or edited in `UniqueActivityList`,
 `internalList` will be sorted according to its `DateTime`. Note that for events, its `DateTime` refers
 to the event's starting time.

=== Task
Task refer to a piece of work to be done that can be added by a user of the application. After being added,
tasks can be edited, completed or removed. When a task is not completed within the deadline, it will be
automatically be marked as overdue.

==== Current Implementation

*_Figure 18_* below shows how `Task` is represented in the application.

.UML Class Diagram for Task
image::TaskUMLDiagram.png[width="550"]

A brief description of each of the attributes of `Task` is given below:

* Name: Represents the name of the task
* dueDateTime: Represents the due date and time of the task
* Remark: Represents a short description or reminder pertaining to the task
* Tags: Groupings or representation for the task

Operations that manipulate a `task` class object can been done using `TaskCommand`, `CompleteCommand`,
`RemoveCommand`, `EditCommand` commands. These commands are described in more detail below.

Operations that manipulate the GUI with respect to `Task` class includes `ListCommand`, `OverdueCommand`.

===== Adding tasks
Tasks can be added through the use of the `TaskCommand`.

The following is a snippet shows how the `executeUndoableCommand()` of `TaskCommand` updates `UniqueActivityList`
residing in model of CLIndar by adding `toAdd`. Note that `toAdd` will not be added if a duplicate task
has been found or the `Name` or `DateTime` field is left empty.

[source,java]
----
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        requireNonNull(model);
        try {
            model.addActivity(toAdd);
            return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS, toAdd));
        } catch (DuplicateActivityException e) {
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_TASK);
        }
    }
----
If the task is successfully added, it will be reflected in the CLIndar GUI itself.

===== Completing Tasks
Tasks can be completed through the use of the `CompleteCommand` by specifying the task's index reflected
in the GUI. Note that `CompleteCommand` can only be applied to `Task`.

Below is a snippet of how the `executeUndoableCommand()` of `CompleteCommand` updates the respective task
to completed.
[source,java]
----
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        requireNonNull(activityToComplete);
        try {
            Activity completedActivity = activityToComplete.getCompletedCopy();
            model.updateActivity(activityToComplete, completedActivity);
        } catch (ActivityNotFoundException pnfe) {
            throw new AssertionError("The target activity cannot be missing");
        } catch (DuplicateActivityException dae) {
            throw new AssertionError("The completed activity cannot be duplicated");
        }
        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_COMPLETE_TASK_SUCCESS, activityToComplete));
    }
----
If `CompleteCommand` is successful, 'Uncompleted' will be updated to 'Completed', which will be reflected in the GUI.

===== Removing Tasks
Tasks can be removed through the use of the `RemoveCommand` by specifying the index of the task reflected
 in the GUI.

The following snippet shows the `executeUndoableCommand()` of the `RemoveCommand` class.
`UniqueActivityList` resides in the `model` will be updated by having `activityToDelete` deleted from it.
If the index of an activity is not found, an `ActivityNotFoundException` will be thrown.

[source,java]
----
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        requireNonNull(activityToDelete);
        try {
            model.deleteActivity(activityToDelete);
        } catch (ActivityNotFoundException pnfe) {
            throw new AssertionError("The target activity cannot be missing");
        }

        /...some code.../
    }
----
If `RemoveCommand` is successful, the relavant `Task`  with the specified index will be removed which
will be reflected in the GUI.

===== Edit Tasks

===== Overdue

Overdue tasks can be viewed through the use of the `OverdueCommand`. Note that the `OverdueCommand` only
lists down overdue tasks; overdue events are marked as completed automatically.

`OverdueCommand` makes use of the LocalDateTime class in Java to check if an ongoing task becomes overdue
or not.

There will be a class in the Model component, which has access to the UniqueActivityList class in that
component. The class will go through the UniqueActivityList and obtain the DateTime of Task, and the end
DateTime of Event. It will then perform a check of the DateTime with `LocalDateTime.now()` and if it is
overdue (for tasks), it will mark the task as overdue, while if it is overdue (for Event), it will mark
it as completed.

===== Design Considerations

* **Alternative 1**: Put the checking method together with UniqueActivityList class
** Pros: Less one class and it is easier for the developer to understand
** Cons: Violates Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). The UniqueAcitivtyList class should not perform the checking.

* **Alternative 2**: Using Google Maps API to obtain current time
** Pros: `LocalDateTime.now()` is reliant on system clock, thus if the system clock is in error, tasks that are overdue will not be marked as
overdue correctly.
** Cons: Reliant on Google Maps API, and might be difficult for the developer to understand.

{empty} +

===== List Task
`ListCommand` allows the user to only view `Task` only in the GUI.
{empty} +
{empty} +

===== Design Considerations

`Task` and `Event` needs to be displayed in the GUI and there are 2 possible implementations to do so:

* **Alternative 1:** Have 1 panel which will display the 2 classes.
** Pros: The coding required for this approach is much lesser.
** Cons: The UI will be messier and less appealing.

* ** Alternative 2 (current choice):** Have 2 panels which will display the 2 classes separately.
** Pros: The backend coding will be neater as the 2 classes do not have the same number of compulsory
information tags. The design of the UI will be much more intuitive too.
** Cons: A lot more coding is required to create the 2 separate panel.
{empty} +
{empty} +

We preferred the second alternative as it adheres more closely with fundamental design principles. The GUI
has to be made as intuitive as possible to bring convenience and comfort to the user. As such, the second alternative is
definitely the preferred approach here.
{empty} +
{empty} +

===== Implementation
The following snippet shows how `execute()` of `ListCommand` displays `Task` on the GUI. If an invalid
request for `ListCommand` happens, a `CommandException` will be thrown.

[source,java]
----
    public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {

        switch(commandRequest)  {
        case "task":
            EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ShowTaskOnlyRequestEvent());
            return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS_TASK);

        /..some code../

        default:
            throw new CommandException(String.format(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_LIST_REQUEST, commandRequest));
        }
    }
----
If `ListCommand` is successful, only `Task` will be shown on the GUI.

=== Event
Event refer to a thing that is about to happen, especially one of importance that can be added by a user
of the application. After being added, events can be edited and deleted. Events past the end date of the
event is automatically completed.

==== Current Implementation

*_Figure 19_* below shows how `Event` is represented in the application.

.UML Class Diagram for Event
image::EventUMLDiagram.png[width="550"]

A brief description of each of the attributes of `Event` is given below:

* Name: Represents the name of the event
* startDateTime: Represents the start date and time of the event
* endDateTime: Represents the end date and time of the event
* Location: Represents the location of the event that is going to happen
* Remark: Represents a short description or reminder pertaining to the event
* Tags: Groupings or representation for the event

Operations that manipulate a `task` class object can been done using
`EventCommand`, `RemoveCommand`, `EditCommand` commands.
These commands are described in more detail below.

Operations that manipulate the GUI with respect to `Task` class includes
`ListCommand`.

===== Add Event
Events can be added through the use of the `EventCommand`.

The way events are added to `UniqueActivityList` is the same as tasks. Note that for events, an exception
will tbe thrown if the `Name`, `DateTime` or, `Location` field is left empty.

If the event is successfully added, it will be reflected in the CLIndar GUI itself.


===== Remove Event
Events can be removed through the use of the `RemoveCommand` by specifying the index of the event reflected
in the GUI. `UniqueActivityList` residing in the `model` will be updated by having `activityToDelete` deleted from it.

The way events are deleted from `UniqueActivityList` is the same as task.

If the `RemoveCommand` is successful, the relavant `Event` with the specified index will be removed which
will be reflected in the GUI.

===== List Event
`ListCommand` allows the user to only view `Event` only in the GUI.

The following snippet shows how `execute()` of `ListCommand` displays `Event` on the GUI. If an invalid
request for `ListCommand` happens, a `CommandException` will be thrown.

[source,java]
----
    public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {

        switch(commandRequest)  {

        /...some code.../

        case "event":
            EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ShowEventOnlyRequestEvent());
            return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS_EVENT);

        /...some code.../

        default:
            throw new CommandException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_LIST_REQUEST, commandRequest));
        }
    }
----
If `ListCommand` is successful, only `Event` will be shown on the GUI.

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Storage for Task and Event

Our application deals with 2 main classes: Task and Event. Hence, when we store the data, we need to
differentiate between these 2 classes. Our team came up with 2 possible implementations to store the data:
{empty} +
{empty} +

==== Design Consideration
* **Alternative 1:** Use 1 list to store objects of both classes
** Pros: There is no need to create 2 separate lists to store the 2 different class objects.
** Cons: Whenever we want to perform an operation on an object stored, we need to check its class.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Use 2 lists to store objects of the 2 classes separately
** Pros: When we want to perform an operation on all the objects stored in a list, each object can be
treated the same as they are from the same class.
** Cons: More effort is required to create 2 separate lists.
{empty} +
{empty} +

While both alternatives have advantages and disadvantages, we feel that the second alternative's
advantages outweigh its disadvantages in the long run. It is easier to maintain the 2 separate lists of
objects, whereby each list contains objects of the same class, especially as we make the 2 classes more
specialized. The inconvenience of creating 2 separate lists will be counterbalanced by the convenience in
the long run.

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing
This sections describes the different ways to do testing on the application.

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.adress.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

[[DevOps]]
== Dev Ops
This sections features softwares which can be used to track the progress of the application development.

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all activities in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the desk board, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the desk board.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/activity/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a activity, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/activity/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each activity, and remove the `tag` from each activity.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
*** The current codebase has a flaw in tags management. Tags no longer in use by anyone may still exist on the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. This may cause some tests to fail. See issue  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/753[`#753`] for more information about this flaw.
*** The solution PR has a temporary fix for the flaw mentioned above in its first commit.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your desk board application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last activity in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside activity cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.
+
**Before**

image::getting-started-ui-tag-before.png[width="300"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-result-after.png[width="200"]
+
****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the desk board is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of activities when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of activities whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of activities status bar.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/803[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the desk board to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the desk board after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the desk board storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the desk board can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAddressBookStorage.java[`XmlAddressBookStorage`] class.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/594[PR] for the full solution.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a activity specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first activity to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first activity.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each activity later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/activity/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/activity/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/activity/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/activity/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the activity will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `deskBoard.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/activity/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the activity that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysTask(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a activity.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.

== Product Scope

*Target user*: University Computing students

*Target user profile*: Our target users are expected to have the following characteristics:

* have a need to manage a significant number of tasks and events
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefer typing over mouse input
* are reasonably comfortable using Linux-style commands and CLI apps

*Value proposition*: The user will have all their tasks and events in one app.
This creates convenience for the user. The CLI also makes it
faster than a typical mouse/GUI-driven app

=== Feature contribution
The following section describes the major and minor enhancements that each of our members contributes to the development of our product.

==== Jarrett
*Major enhancement*: Creating 'overdue' command. This command shows a list of overdue tasks.

*Minor enhancement*: Creating 'task' and 'event' commands which add Task and Event objects respectively.

==== Jasmund
*Major enhancement*: Modifying the GUI to fit our task/event manager application. This includes but is not limited to allowing the UI to display 2 panes for showing the Task and Event lists separately.

*Minor enhancement*: Modifying the 'help' command. In our application, 'help' can be followed by a command word (e.g. 'help task') so that instructions for only the command desired are shown. Moreover, 'man' command -- an alias for 'help' -- is also added for users who are familiar with Linux commands.

==== Karen
*Major enhancement*: Modifying the Storage component to allow storage of Tasks and Events in an xml file.

*Minor enhancement*: Creating 'ls' command. This command shows the Event and Task objects added to the Desk Board in 2 separate lists.

==== Yuan Quan
*Major enhancement*: Modifying the Model component. This includes creation of Event and Task classes, as well as their superclass, Activity. Other classes relevant to tasks and events are also created, such as DateTime.

*Minor enhancement*: Creating 'complete' command. This command marks a Task object as completed.
